        <h1>John David McAfee</h1>
        <h2>General Knowledge</h2>
        <p>A British-American computer programmer and businessman. Most commonly known for being the founder of McAFee Associates, 
            the first commercial antivirus software, in 1987 until his resignation in 1994. Since leaving McAfee Associates, he has 
            founded companies such as Tribal Voice, QuorumEx and Future Tense Central, among other. He's also been involved in leadership 
            positions in companies like MGT, Luxcore, Capital Investments, and many more.</p>
        <p>However, what many don't know is the kind of life John David McAFee has lead to this point in his life.</p>
        <h2>Early Years</h2>
        <p>Born in England on September 18th, 1945, not too long after his family relocates to Roanoke, Virginia. He obtained a degree
            in mathematics at Roanoke College, then started working for a string of tech companies and government agencies such as 
            NASA, Xerox and Booz Allen Hamilton to name a few.</p>
        <p>However, during this time he's constantly losing jobs because of drugs and booze. He was selling coke and snorting it while 
            working at Omix and lost his job at Pacific Railroad after showing up to work after doing a whole bag of DMT. When McAfee started working 
            at Lockheed Martin, he speaks of his surprise at being hired and having security clearance. In this interview he says,</p> 
        <p class="interview">"I had a very checkered past prior to joining Lockheed Martin. I assumed that there would be no chance in hell I would ever get security clearance...
            They asked me very re--, y'know?Revealing questions. 'Had I ever had sex with sheep or, or, or dogs?'... or 'Had I ever taken drugs?' The
            answer...? Yes. 'Uhh, what kind?' Almost every kind. 'Uhhm, how much?' A lot. 'Have you ever sold drugs?' Yes. So I assumed I would never 
            get the clearance but I did and it came in very quickly. "</p>
